<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

LotteryMiniPay is a transparent blockchain-based lottery platform built on Celo that pools resources from participants and distributes rewards to lucky winners, empowering them to develop their potential and create positive social impact. The platform leverages the power of blockchain to ensure transparency, fairness, and security in all lottery operations.

Our mission is to democratize access to opportunity capital while creating engaging experiences for participants. Each ticket represents both a chance at financial reward and a contribution toward empowering individuals to pursue education, launch businesses, develop community initiatives, or implement innovative solutions to local challenges.

## Project Description

LotteryMiniPay transforms the traditional lottery model into a powerful tool for social impact. By combining the excitement of chance with the mission of community empowerment, we create a win-win ecosystem:

### Problem
In many communities, talented individuals with promising ideas lack access to capital needed to pursue their dreams and create positive social impact. Traditional funding methods are often inaccessible, requiring extensive networks, collateral, or existing resources.

### Solution
Our platform provides:
1. Transparent and fair lottery system built on blockchain technology
2. Affordable ticket purchasing with cUSD
3. Secure number selection and verification
4. Automatic prize distribution to winners
5. Sustainable operations through a modest 10% platform fee

### Impact
By distributing opportunity through chance, we foster societies where talent isn't limited by economic circumstances. Winners can use their prizes to:
- Launch entrepreneurial ventures that create jobs
- Pursue education and skill development
- Fund community improvement initiatives
- Develop innovative solutions to local challenges

## How It Works

1. **Create Lottery Rooms**: Admin creates lottery rooms with specific entry fees, draw times, and encrypted winning numbers.

2. **Buy Tickets**: Users purchase tickets by selecting numbers (0-99) and paying the entry fee in cUSD.

3. **Winning Number Reveal**: At the scheduled draw time, the admin reveals the winning number with cryptographic verification.

4. **Claim Prizes**: Winners claim their prizes directly to their wallets.

5. **Continuous Rounds**: Rooms can be reset for new rounds, carrying over unclaimed prizes.

The smart contract ensures all operations are transparent, fair, and secure, with anti-fraud measures like reentrancy protection and secure number verification.
